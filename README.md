# Diabetes-dataset-trained-with-DT-model
## Diabetes Prediction using Decision Trees

# Overview
This project uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. The dataset used is from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

# Dataset
The dataset contains 768 instances with 8 attributes and 1 class variable. The attributes include:

- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin
- BMI: Body mass index
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age in years
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)

The dataset is specific to individuals of Pima Indian heritage, aged 21 years and above.

# Model
The model used for training is a Decision Tree Classifier. The classifier is trained on the dataset and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, F1 score, and confusion matrix.

# Results
The results of the project include:

- Accuracy of the model
- Precision of the model
- F1 score of the model
- Confusion matrix of the model
- Feature importance of the attributes

# Usage
To use this project, simply clone the repository and run the code. The code is written in Python and uses libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn.

# License
The dataset is licensed under CC0: Public Domain.
